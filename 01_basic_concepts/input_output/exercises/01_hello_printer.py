"""
Exercise 01: Hello Printer
Goal: Practice basic print() usage
"""

# TODO: Step 1 - Print a simple greeting
# Example:
# print("Hello, World!")
# Example Output: Hello, I am programming in Python!

# Write your own greeting message here (e.g. "Hi there! I'm learning Python!")

# TODO: Step 2 - Print multiple lines using separate print() calls
# Example:
# print("Welcome to PCAP Prep!")
# print("This is Exercise 01.")
# Example Output:
# Welcome to PCAP Prep!
# This is Exercise 01.

# Now write exactly two lines of your own below
# ⚠️ Output must be two lines only (not more, not less)

# TODO: Step 3 - Print a single line with multiple comma-separated items
# Pre-defined variables:
city = "New York"
year = 2025
# Example:
# print("City:", city, "Year:", year)
# Example Output: City: New York Year: 2025

# Now create your own print statement using BOTH variables above
# Do NOT change the value of city and year

# TODO: Step 4 - Use the 'end' parameter to print without line breaks
# Example: Simulate a progress bar
# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i, end=" ")
# print()  # for newline
# Example Output: 1 2 3 4 5

# Now print the numbers from 2 to 7 (inclusive) on the same line, separated by dashes
# Expected output: 2-3-4-5-6-7
# Hint: Use a loop and only add a dash if it's not the last number

# ✅ Try running your code after each step to see the output
# 🔍 When you're ready, you can validate your solution automatically using:
# > py tests/01_basic_concepts_test/input_output_test/test_01_hello_printer.py
# Make sure your output matches exactly what is expected for each step.
